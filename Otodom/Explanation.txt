**Data Analysis Report**

In this analysis, we worked with a MySQL dataset containing property listings from the "otodom" database. The dataset consists of various attributes related to properties listed for sale. Our objective was to extract insights from the dataset using Python and various libraries for data manipulation, visualization, and analysis. We addressed a series of questions to gain insights into different aspects of the dataset.

**Python Libraries Used:**
- `pymysql` for connecting to the MySQL database and fetching data.
- `pandas` for data manipulation and analysis.
- `matplotlib` and `seaborn` for data visualization.
- `sklearn` for linear regression and correlation analysis.

**Questions Explored:**

1. **Distribution of Listings Between Different Markets:**
We visualized the distribution of listings across different markets using a bar chart, allowing us to compare listing counts for each market.

2. **Variation of Average Price Across Different Markets:**
We plotted the average price for each market, offering insights into how property prices vary among markets.

3. **Highest and Lowest Average Prices by Location:**
By analyzing location-based average prices, we identified the locations with the highest and lowest average property prices.

4. **Correlation Between Surface Area and Price:**
We used scatter plots to explore whether there's a correlation between the surface area of properties and their prices.

5. **Distribution of Remote Support Feature:**
We examined the distribution of properties with remote support as a feature, segmented by market.

6. **Common Advertiser Types:**
We determined the most common advertiser types using bar charts, giving an overview of who lists properties most frequently.

7. **Relationship Between Number of Rooms and Price:**
Scatter plots helped us understand how the number of rooms in a property relates to its price.

8. **Distribution of Different Property Forms:**
We created a bar chart to visualize the distribution of various property forms within the dataset.

9. **Ratio of Properties For Sale vs. Not For Sale:**
We calculated the ratio of properties listed for sale versus those not for sale and visualized it using a bar chart.

10. **Markets With Highest Number of Listings For Sale:**
We identified the markets with the highest number of listings available for sale.

11. **Differences in Price Between Properties With Different Forms:**
By comparing box plots, we explored potential differences in prices based on different property forms.

12. **Properties With Highest Price Per Square Meter:**
We calculated the price per square meter for each property and found those with the highest values.

13. **Correlation Between Keywords and Higher Prices:**
We performed text analysis to identify keywords in property descriptions that correlated with higher prices.

14. **Distribution of Property Types Across Markets:**
We visualized the distribution of property types in different markets using a stacked bar chart.

**Insights and Observations:**

- Certain markets have significantly higher listing counts than others, indicating varying levels of real estate activity.
- Property prices exhibit notable differences between markets, suggesting the influence of location on pricing.
- Locations with higher average prices are often associated with more upscale neighborhoods or prime areas.
- Positive correlations between surface area and price hint at larger properties being generally more expensive.
- Remote support feature appears to be relatively common in the dataset, with varying adoption across markets.
- Individual property owners are common advertisers, while professional agencies also have a significant presence.
- Properties with more rooms tend to have higher prices, aligning with the assumption of larger and more valuable properties.
- Apartments dominate the property forms, followed by houses and other types.
- The ratio of properties for sale versus not for sale is indicative of market dynamics.
- Certain markets exhibit a high concentration of listings for sale, reflecting market supply and demand.
- Price differences between property forms might be influenced by factors specific to each type.
- Properties with the highest price per square meter might indicate premium locations or unique features.
- Keywords in descriptions like "luxury," "spacious," or "exclusive" could correlate with higher prices.
- Different markets show distinct preferences for property types, potentially due to local trends and demand.

**Concluding Remarks:**

Through extensive data analysis and visualization, we have gained valuable insights into the dataset's characteristics and its relationships. We've explored diverse aspects of the real estate market, from prices and property forms to market dynamics and features. While this report highlights key findings, further in-depth analysis and domain-specific insights could be derived with more sophisticated techniques.
